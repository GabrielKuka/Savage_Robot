###__Description:__
GE3 is designed and built in the laboratory of Harry T. Fultz Institute. It is a remote controlled device designed and created with basic home condition objects. The robot grabs ping pong balls, puts them in a hand-made bucket and throws them in certain places when it is needed. The central CPU circuit is an Arduino UNO R3. It is programmed to be controlled with a XBOX 360 controller. The code to operate with the device is found in this repository.
